## To All the contributors 

--this is the backend of howsapp repo link below
https://github.com/Jhaempyre/HowsApp

I have done some basic login authentication and messaging api but this was casual 

what needs to be done ???

--create better user models storing details of users more precisely
--create middlewares
--create uploading of image and media apis 
---create solid authentication using middleware
--please do employ socket in this 

--a notification system 


and much more what ever you want 

please open the pr . do the changes once submitted and reviewed will be merged to the main branch ..

you must have a local mongodbclient installed to use the connectionstring in env otherwise for atlas and other do change the connection string itself

for https 
`git clone https://github.com/Jhaempyre/backend`
via ssh do chek it in repo itseld

`cd backend`

`npm i`

`npm run dev`

it will run on port 5000

Looking for the contriutors to show thier skills and make this project a succesfull one .
